    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from
        Southeastern
        Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that
        has
        been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a
        pullet.
    </p>

    <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but
        the
        clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From
        ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl
        have
        been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from
        the
        land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]

    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
    <p>Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny,
        pointed
        feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than
        those
        of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only
        slightly
        pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or
        eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male
        and
        female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb,
        or
        cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other
        fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles
        and
        combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several
        chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[31]</p>
